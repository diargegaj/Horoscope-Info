# Horoscope-Info
Horoscope Info is an android app who use MVVM, RxJava and Room Database.

In this APP I use Recycler View to show all Signs, I used view Pager and TabLayout to show the horoscope info in three days (yesterday, today, tomorrow)

In this app I used SSOT (Single Source of Truth). 
As we know the SSOT is when we observe only in one source of data, in my case in Local Database and updated that data from API.

If you are a beggniner in this project you can learn a lot of things.
